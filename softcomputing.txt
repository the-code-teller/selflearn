Course 1: Introduction to Soft Computing

Teacher Name : Prof Debasis Samanta

Teacher Designation: Faculty member at the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at IIT Kharagpur.

Course Description:   I take this  opportunity to welcome you to the course Soft Computing. Soft computing is an emerging approach to computing which parallel the remarkable ability of the human mind to reason and learn in an environment of uncertainty and imprecision. Soft computing is based on some biological inspired methodologies such as genetics, evolution, ant’s behaviors, particles swarming, human nervous systems, etc. Now, soft computing is the only solution when we don’t have any mathematical modeling of problem solving (i.e., algorithm), need a solution to a complex problem in real time, easy to adapt with changed scenario and can be implemented with parallel computing. It has enormous applications in many application areas such as medical diagnosis, computer vision, hand written character recondition, pattern recognition, machine intelligence, weather forecasting, network optimization, VLSI design, etc.
